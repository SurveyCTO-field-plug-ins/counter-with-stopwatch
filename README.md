# Stopwatch with counter

*This plug-in is in-progress, and may not work correctly.*

## Description

Use this to check how long something takes, using a counter to keep track as well. There is also a button to lower the counter in case the enumerator makes a mistake. Because there are two space-separated values, this can only be used with a 'text' field. You will also need to setup the constraint `count-selected(.) = 2`.
